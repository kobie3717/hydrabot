"""Owner signature verification for preference memories (Week 5, sub-step 5.2).

Pure cryptographic verification primitive. No admission logic, no publish
validation — just the gate itself. Callers (5.4) will wire this into
preference_admission.py after same-owner string check.

TRUST MODEL (locked by design doc Q2, Q4):
- Owner is the trust anchor (Kobus), not the agent (Friday/Claw)
- Public key lookup is by owner_id, NEVER by agent_id
- agent_id is in the payload for audit trail, not for key resolution
- This allows multiple agents to share the same owner key

PAYLOAD BINDING (locked by design doc Q2, R1):
- Signed payload: {owner_id, agent_id, memory_id, timestamp} (exactly 4 fields)
- memory_id binding prevents signature replay across different memories
- timestamp binding prevents indefinite replay (±5min window)
- Verification fails if ANY field mismatches caller's assertion

TIMESTAMP WINDOW (locked by design doc Q2, R3):
- Bidirectional check: reject if too old OR too future
- Window: ±5 minutes relative to shared_at
- Distinct reason codes for expired vs future (ops clarity)

FAIL-CLOSED (locked by design doc R4):
- Never raises for bad input (missing fields, unknown owner, bad sig)
- Only raises for true infra errors (DB connection drop, SQLite corruption)
- Returns structured VerificationResult with reason code

CANONICALIZATION (locked by design doc R5):
- Reuses bundle_signing.canonicalize_for_signing (W3 helper)
- One canonical form across codebase, zero hand-rolled JSON serialization

FUNCTION SIGNATURE (locked by design doc R6):
- Caller passes raw fields (owner_id, agent_id, memory_id, timestamp, signature)
- Function reconstructs canonical payload internally from raw fields
- Never accepts pre-built payload blob (ensures signed surface = verified surface)

    """Verify owner signature on preference memory binding.

    This is a pure verification primitive. It does NOT:
    - Check if owner_id matches server's CIRCUS_OWNER_ID (that's gate 4, already done)
    - Check if domain is "preference.user" (that's publish validation, 5.3)
    - Check confidence threshold (that's gate 6, after this)

    It ONLY verifies:
    1. Owner's public key exists in owner_keys table (lookup by owner_id)
    2. Signature is cryptographically valid against that public key
    3. Signed payload matches claimed fields (owner_id, agent_id, memory_id, timestamp)
    4. Timestamp is within ±5min of shared_at (bidirectional window)

    ORDERING (efficiency — cheap checks first, crypto last):
    1. Look up public key (DB query) → owner_key_unknown if missing
    2. Check timestamp window (arithmetic) → expired/future if out of bounds
    3. Verify signature (crypto) → owner_signature_invalid if bad

    This means memory_id mismatches surface as owner_signature_invalid
    (the reconstructed payload won't match what was signed), which is correct:
    the memory_id binding is enforced BY CRYPTOGRAPHY, not string equality.

    Args:
        claimed_owner_id: Owner ID from provenance.owner_id (used for key lookup)
        claimed_agent_id: Agent ID from owner_binding.agent_id (audit trail)
        claimed_memory_id: Memory ID from owner_binding.memory_id (replay prevention)
        claimed_timestamp: ISO8601 timestamp from owner_binding.timestamp
        signature_b64: Base64 Ed25519 signature from owner_binding.signature
        shared_at: ISO8601 timestamp from memory envelope (for window check)
        conn: SQLite connection for owner_keys lookup

    Returns:
        VerificationResult with valid=True on success, valid=False + reason on failure

    Reason codes:
        - owner_key_unknown: claimed_owner_id not in owner_keys table
        - owner_binding_invalid_timestamp: malformed timestamp (parse failure)
        - owner_binding_expired: timestamp too old (>5min before shared_at)
        - owner_binding_future_timestamp: timestamp too far ahead (>5min after shared_at)
        - owner_signature_invalid: signature verification failed (bad sig OR field mismatch)

    Raises:
        Only on true infrastructure errors (DB connection drop, SQLite corruption).
        Bad input (malformed binding, missing fields, etc.) returns VerificationResult
        with valid=False, never raises.
